# CodeRefinery in a day

This course provides an introduction to essential practices in research software engineering, with a strong focus on collaboration, reproducibility, and sustainability. Participants will learn the fundamentals of version control and how to effectively collaborate on texts in GitHub. The course also explores key concepts in reproducible research, including organizing projects, a brief overview of environments and containers. In addition, it covers the social aspects of coding, such as software licensing, citation, and open collaboration. By the end, learners will know about best practices for developing and sharing research software more efficiently and transparently.

This course is a condensed version of the [CodeRefinery workshop](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/#lessons-that-we-teach-in-our-tools-workshops)

## Who is the course for?

This course is for you, if you are in a position where you might want to support researchers with programming and its reproducibility. 

This course is not designed for "professional software engineers" or to make you one.

## About the course

In this course, you will get a quick overview of tools and best practices for research software development. This course will not teach a programming language, but we aim to show you some tools and techniques to be able to guide researchers to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps. The tools we teach are practically a requirement for any researcher who needs to write code. The main focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research software or other content.
